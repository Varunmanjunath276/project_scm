## How It Works (Client-Side Simulation)

The app's magic happens in your browser:

1.  Authentication: User data is stored and checked against localStorage. 🔒
2.  Resume Processing: PDFs are parsed using pdf.js to extract text; pasted text is used directly. 📖📝
3.  AI Simulation: JavaScript functions simulate:
     Skill Matching: Checks resume text against predefined skills. ✨
     Experience Level: Estimates based on keywords/years mentioned. ⏳
     Company Matching: Selects from predefined companies based on skills/themes. 🏢
     Salary Generation: Creates salary ranges based on experience and company tiers with variations. 💸
4.  File Conversion: This is simulated, providing dummy output/download links. ➡📁

## Tech Stack
